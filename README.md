# RF_MOPSO
These functions are included the "Random Forest" and the hybrid Random Forest and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization ("RF_MOPSO") to predict the targets as learning approach and find the optimal parameters of a multi-feature process, respectively. The example of this version is a drilling process prediction and optimization.

The MOPSO algorithm was obtained via:

Víctor Martínez-Cagigal (2022). Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62074-multi-objective-particle-swarm-optimization-mopso), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved July 27, 2022.

Besides, the MOPSO implementation is based on the paper of Coello et al. (2004), "Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization".
