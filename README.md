# RF_MOPSO
These functions are included the "Random Forest" and the hybrid Random Forest and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization ("RF_MOPSO") to predict the targets as learning approach and find the optimal parameters of a multi-feature process, respectively. The example of this version is a drilling process prediction and optimization.
Instruction to use the codes:

The Random Forest and hybrid RF_MOPSO algorithms are run via "Random_Forest.m" and "example_final.m" files, respectively. There is a dataset to implement each method, "data1.csv" is for Random Forest and "data.csv" is belonged to RF_MOPSO. These algorithms indicate the results of the prediction and optimization in MATLAB software.

The MOPSO algorithm was obtained via:

Víctor Martínez-Cagigal (2022). Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62074-multi-objective-particle-swarm-optimization-mopso), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved July 27, 2022.

Besides, the MOPSO implementation is based on the paper of Coello et al. (2004), "Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization".
