# RF_MOPSO
This hybrid function performs by Random Forest and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) to find the optimal parameters of a multi-feature process. The example of this version is a drilling process optimization.

The MOPSO algorithm was obtained via:

Víctor Martínez-Cagigal (2022). Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62074-multi-objective-particle-swarm-optimization-mopso), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved July 27, 2022.

Besides, the MOPSO implementation is based on the paper of Coello et al. (2004), "Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization".
